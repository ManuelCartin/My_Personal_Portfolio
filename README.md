# # AI Engineer | Applied Modeling & Intelligent Systems

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Data Science student focused on applied Artificial Intelligence and intelligent systems. 
My work combines modeling, simulation, and machine learning to transform complex data into structured, decision-ready solutions.

## 🌱 My Philosophy  

## Engineering Approach

- Strong technical foundations before abstraction.
- Practical implementation over theoretical accumulation.
- Continuous iteration and experimentation.
- Collaboration as a force multiplier in technical teams.

🧪 Experiments and Tests

In addition to the main projects, I maintain a dedicated Experiments Repository
.

This space is for:

Unpolished projects → ideas still in development.

Technical practice → data cleaning, integration, or exploratory workflows.

Curiosity-driven work → experiments that may later become full portfolio projects.

📌 Example experiment:
## 🧪 Experiments and Tests  

In addition to the main projects, I maintain a dedicated repository for experiments and technical practice:  
- **[Data Experiment](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Data_Experiment)** → Collection of experiments and exploratory projects.  
  - [F1 Climate Comparison](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Data_Experiment/tree/main/f1_climate_comparacion) → Merging and cleaning weather datasets from four Formula 1 circuits (Spa, Bahrain, Miami, and Singapore) to build a consolidated dataset for climate analysis.  
  - *(More experiments will be added as I continue exploring)*
