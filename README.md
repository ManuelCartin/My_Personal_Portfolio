# # AI Engineer | Applied Modeling & Intelligent Systems

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Data Science student focused on applied Artificial Intelligence and intelligent systems. 
My work combines modeling, simulation, and machine learning to transform complex data into structured, decision-ready solutions.

---

## Engineering Approach

- Strong technical foundations before abstraction.
- Practical implementation over theoretical accumulation.
- Continuous iteration and experimentation.
- Collaboration as a force multiplier in technical teams.

---

## Main Projects  

- **[F1_Climate_season_Predict](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/F1_Climate_Season_predict)** → Analysis of the F1 season with climate data. *(In progress)*
- **[Weather and Crime](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Proyect_Crime_Meteo)** → Climate impact analysis on crime. Ongoing project with **continuous updates and model improvements *(In progress)***.

## University Projects  

- [Fidélitas University Projects](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/University_Fidelitas_Project) → Coursework and applied research in Data Science Engineering.

Experiments and Tests

In addition to the main projects, I maintain a dedicated Experiments Repository
.

This space is for:

Unpolished projects → ideas still in development.

Technical practice → data cleaning, integration, or exploratory workflows.

Curiosity-driven work → experiments that may later become full portfolio projects.

## Relevant Certifications  

IBM Data Science Professional Certificate  
- Applied Capstone Project (multi-stage predictive modeling)
Autonomous Vehicle Engineer
- tire model (matlab/simulink and jupyter notebook)

### In Progress  
- **IBM Data Engineer**  
  - [Linux Automation Project](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/IBM_Data_Engineer_Course6_Proyect) → Automated workflows with Linux Shell scripting.
