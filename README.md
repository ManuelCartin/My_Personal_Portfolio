# 🚀 AI Engineer Portfolio  

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Data Science student pursuing a career as an **AI Engineer**.  
My motto is to take data with a grain of salt: beyond models and metrics, I believe in building **data products that not only work, but also tell a story**.  

Here you will find my most ambitious projects — from Formula 1 strategy analysis 🏎️ to climate impact studies 🌦️ — and how I use Artificial Intelligence to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## 🌱 My Philosophy  

I firmly believe that **hard work is the best way to grow**.  
This portfolio not only showcases my main projects but also my academic work and practice exercises.  

I don’t aim to be "the best," but rather to prepare myself to collaborate with those who will one day be my colleagues and peers.  
If one of us improves, we all improve — with the shared goal of creating solutions that help those in need.

## 📌 Main Projects  

- **[F1 Insights](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/F1_Project_Data_engineering)** → Created a data product for **strategic analysis in Formula 1**, including lap predictions and pit-stop optimization.  
- **[Weather and Crime](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Proyect_Crime_Meteo)** → Climate impact analysis on crime. Ongoing project with **continuous updates and model improvements**.  
- **[Synthetic Dataset for Perishables](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Perishable_RNN_Project)** → Generated synthetic data and trained **RNN models** to predict product freshness. *(In progress)*  
- **[F1 API & Race Strategy](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/f1-merged-analysis-2022-2024_and_analsys)** → Built a pipeline for **F1 data extraction via API** and strategy simulation for performance insights.  
- **[Cloud Analysis and Risk Prevention](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Cloud_Analisys_Predict)** → AI model for **aviation safety risk prevention** through cloud pattern detection.

🧪 Experiments and Tests

In addition to the main projects, I maintain a dedicated Experiments Repository
.

This space is for:

Unpolished projects → ideas still in development.

Technical practice → data cleaning, integration, or exploratory workflows.

Curiosity-driven work → experiments that may later become full portfolio projects.

📌 Example experiment:
## 🧪 Experiments and Tests  

In addition to the main projects, I maintain a dedicated repository for experiments and technical practice:  
- **[Data Experiment](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Data_Experiment)** → Collection of experiments and exploratory projects.  
  - [F1 Climate Comparison](https://github.com/ManuelCartin/Data_Experiment/tree/main/f1_climate_comparacion) → Merging and cleaning weather datasets from four Formula 1 circuits (Spa, Bahrain, Miami, and Singapore) to build a consolidated dataset for climate analysis.  
  - *(More experiments will be added as I continue exploring)*
